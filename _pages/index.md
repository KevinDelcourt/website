Since January 2025 I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at [GEODES](https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/) at the Université de Montréal. In November 2024 I got my Ph.D. from the Toulouse Research Institute of Computer Science ([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/)), where my main area of research was Ambient Intelligence and Human-AI interaction.

My current area of research is software engineering, and in particular applied to artificial intelligence and digital twins. 

# Research Projects

## Modeling Cold Plasma Processes for Material Discovery

Since 2025, I have been working on a project aimed at creating a digital twin of cold plasma processes to accelerate material discovery. Cold plasma processes are highly complex and challenging to understand but have the potential to yield impressive results, such as in the design of clean batteries. Progress toward a digital twin of these processes could help researchers understand and conceive new materials with remarkable properties.  

This project is in collaboration with the departments of [Physics](https://phys.umontreal.ca/english/home/) and [Chemistry](https://chimie.umontreal.ca/english/) at UdeM.  

## Opportunistic Software Composition

During my Ph.D. studies, I worked on the [OppoCompo](https://www.irit.fr/OppoCompo/) project. With the advent of the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems are characterized by openness and an increasing number of devices. The **OppoCompo** approach proposes leveraging these devices as they appear or disappear to automatically create customized applications that suit user preferences.  

My work focused on the multi-agent system at the heart of this approach and how it can interactively learn user preferences to create customized applications. I designed and conducted an online [experiment on Human-AI interaction](https://oppocompo-exp.irit.fr/), gathering data from over 150 participants, to study the impact of the interaction design on usability and the AI performance.
